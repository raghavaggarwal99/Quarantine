# Purpose

So I tried, to be productive during this Quarantine period. I always wanted to do a 100 days of Algo sort of thing but I always
though I wouldn't be able to complete it. Here is a start to this.

## 1. TF-IDF

This is basic brute force implentation of the TF-IDF Algorithm for making the search engine. I haven't used any ranking algorithm
You can use any one of them Cosine Similarity or Page Ranking Algorithm(Used by Google)

## 2. Sentiment Analysis

This is used for categorising any text(review/tweets) whether it is a positive review or a negative review

## 3. Cosine Similarity

This is used to find similarities between two texts. Pretty starightforward algo
