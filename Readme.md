# Purpose

So I tried, to be productive during this Quarantine period. I always wanted to do a 100 days of Algo sort of thing but I always
though I wouldn't be able to complete it. Here is a start to this.
Ps I hate neural networks thing so this is basically what everything I like 

## 1. TF-IDF

This is basic brute force implentation of the TF-IDF Algorithm for making the search engine. I haven't used any ranking algorithm
You can use any one of them Cosine Similarity or Page Ranking Algorithm(Used by Google)

## 2. Sentiment Analysis

This is used for categorising any text(review/tweets) whether it is a positive review or a negative review

## 3. Cosine Similarity

This is used to find similarities between two texts. Pretty starightforward algo

## 4. Latent Dirchlet Allocation
LDA is used for Topic Modelling. Given documents, It can tell you the topics in which all documents fall into given the no. of the topics are specified

## 5. Text Summarisation

I have not used any Deep Learning Technique for this, Just a simple Math Algo in NLP


## 5. Logistic Regression
Not able to commit for a while, I don't like neural networks part. I found some cool concepts of NLP like Intent Classification and Emotion Analysis but I don't want to do it with keras and implementing the neural networks. Anyways Here is a Logistic Regression for now. It is coded from scratch. Haven't used the STL.
